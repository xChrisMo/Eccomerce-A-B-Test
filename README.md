# A/B Test

## Project Overview

In this project, the aim of this A/B test is to find out if certain changes to the website can lead to more purchases. A/B testing means comparing two versions of a webpage to see which one gets more conversions. This method uses data to make smart decisions that improve user experience and increase sales.

## Program Structure

1. Testing Notebook  
2. Testing Data 
3. Powerpoint Summary 

The notebook is divided into several part, each focusing on different aspects of our statistical analysis:

1. **Introduction**
2. **Part I - Descriptive Statistics**
3. **Part II - Probability**
4. **Part III - Experimentation**
5. **Part IV - Algorithms**


## Libraries Used
- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
- numpy: For numerical operations
- matplotlib: For creating static visualizations
- statsodel: For statistical modelling and testing

## Files in the Repository
- `ab_test_summary.pptx`: Powerpoint presentation of full wrangling and exploration
- `AB_Test_Final.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook of wrangling
- `ab_data.csv.csv`: Dataset containing data for statistical modelling


## How to Use
1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure you have all the required libraries installed
3. Open the `AB_Test_Final.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or your preferred environment
4. Run the cells to reproduce the analysis
5. To get a comprehensive summary, be sure to read the `ab_test_summary.pptx` before or after examining the notebook
